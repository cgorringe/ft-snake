## ft-snake - Snake Deathmatch
This is a multi-player Snake Game that runs on the [Flaschen Taschen](https://noisebridge.net/wiki/Flaschen_Taschen) LED display at Noisebridge.

By [Carl Gorringe](http://carl.gorringe.org)

Check out my other [Demos](https://github.com/cgorringe/ft-demos) and [Music Module Player](https://github.com/cgorringe/ft-mod) for the Flaschen Taschen.

### How to Install

#### Code is Not Yet Ready to Use

These instructions assume you're running a Mac or Linux OS.  No effort has been made to test it on Windows.

This code depends on the C++ framework provided by the [flaschen-taschen](https://github.com/hzeller/flaschen-taschen) project.  Since it's being used as a sub-module, you'll need to clone this repo using the `--recursive` option:

```
  git clone --recursive https://github.com/cgorringe/ft-snake
```

This program is meant to run directly on the Raspberry Pi that the Flaschen Taschen runs on.
